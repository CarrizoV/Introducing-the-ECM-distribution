# Instructions

The file `FitChile2021.R` contains the routine that fits the data from the Chilean 2021 presidential election. It uses Maximum Gaussian Likelihood Estimation, then performs parametric bootstrapping for uncertainty quantification. The routine saves the results of the bootstrapping on the file `L.bootstrap`.

This folder also contains, in the `.xlsx` files, the results of both round of the election. Those files where obtained from the website of the Chilean [_Tribunal Calificador de Elecciones_](https://tribunalcalificador.cl/resultados_de_elecciones/).
