# Introducing the ECM distribution
R routines and R functions for reproducing the results in Carrizo Vergara et al (2025).

The folder "R functions" contains R functions which are called by the R routines. 

The folder "R routines" contains the R routines used to obtain the results. There are three subfolders on it, one for each illustration presented in the paper. The routines for fitting and analyzing lesser prairie-chicken data are found in "FittingChickens". The routines for reproducing and analyzing the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck based simulation studies are found in "SimuStudyOU". The routines for fitting and analyzing the Chilean 2021 presidential election vote transfer are found in "FittingChile2021". See the README file in each folder for more information.
